        <div>The Saito Network has 7bb SAITO tokens and a zero-inflation policy. Because Saito is a non-inflationary token, the only way to get tokens is to purchase them from other holders or run network servers and earn them in exchange for routing transaction fees into the network. This makes Saito tokenomics fundamentally different than proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mechanisms that require token inflation to pay for network services and use issuance and lock-up games to debase holders.</div>
        <div>While most tokens in circulation exist on that main network, approximately 30 percent of Saito tokens started circulating in the form of ERC20 / BEP20 tokens. You can aquire those on the exchange of your choice, e.g. GateIO, Latoken, Bitrue, Uniswap, PancakeSwap, or Dexpro.</div>
        <div>If you are holding ERC20 Saito tokens, we have a <a href="/migration"> migration service</a> to bridge them onto the network.</div>
        <div>See the <a href="https://wiki.saito.io/en/tokenomics">Tokenomics</a> Wiki page for more information.</div>
